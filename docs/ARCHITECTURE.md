# Architecture

[← Documentation](README.md)

How the app is put together. Each part has its own docs; this page says which part does what.

## Four repositories

| Repository | Here as | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **bloodborne-mac** (this one) | | Packages the macOS app and its DMG, publishes releases, holds the player guides and the roadmap |
| [bloodborne-launcher](https://github.com/bloodborne-native/bloodborne-launcher) | `launcher/` | The launcher (Tauri: React and Rust): profiles, saves, settings, mods, patches, starting the game and tracking trophies |
| [bloodborne-runtime](https://github.com/bloodborne-native/bloodborne-runtime) | `runtime/` | Runs the game: loads its executable, provides the PS4 system libraries, draws on native Metal by default or MoltenVK as a fallback |
| [bloodborne-recomp](https://github.com/bloodborne-native/bloodborne-recomp) | `runtime/recomp/` | bbcpu, which runs the game's x86-64 code on arm64, and the recompiler that turns it into native code ahead of time |

The runtime is built on [bbport](https://github.com/deadinside28/bloodborne_pc), the native Linux
port this project started from, and on [shadPS4](https://github.com/shadps4-emu/shadPS4).

## Where code lives

Code lives where it changes, not where it was first needed (decided 2026-10-27, after the iOS
proof of concept):

- **The runtime and the recompiler know every platform the game can run on:** macOS, Linux and
  iOS each behind the runtime's platform layer, selected by the build (a CMake preset), not
  scattered through the code. A fix that one platform exposed but that is not about that platform
  (the game's mutex, a recompiler pattern, a UI scale) goes to `main` for all of them, measured on
  each. There are no per-platform forks of the runtime.
- **A platform's app repository is the app on that platform:** its shell, build and signing
  scripts, packaging, CI and releases, and what being an app there means (touch controls, file
  sharing, system integration). bloodborne-mac is that for macOS; an iOS app would be
  bloodborne-ios.
- **The launcher is one codebase for every platform:** its layout already works on phone-sized
  screens.

The iOS proof of concept is on the runtime's and the recompiler's `main` since 2026-10-29: its
platform code behind `TARGET_OS_IPHONE`, its general fixes for every platform
([write-up](https://github.com/bloodborne-native/bloodborne-runtime/blob/main/docs/IOS_POC.md)).
It also showed what keeps the runtime from being embedded: it is a program (`bb-probe`) started by
`run.sh`, which prepares the game with bash and Python. iOS allows one process and neither tool,
so the runtime has to become a library with a small C API, with the preparation in the runtime or
the launcher. The steps are in the [roadmap](ROADMAP.md).

## The app

`packaging/macos.sh` builds `Bloodborne.app` from the runtime's build and the launcher:

| In the bundle | |
|---|---|
| `Contents/MacOS/` | the launcher, `bb-probe` (the game), `bb-gpu-capabilities`, bash |
| `Contents/Frameworks/` | the runtime's GPU library, SDL3, FFmpeg, plus MoltenVK and the Vulkan loader for the fallback only |
| `Contents/Resources/game/` | `run.sh`, the runtime's scripts and patches, the Vulkan driver manifest |
| `Contents/Resources/python/` | a standalone Python 3 |

Library references are rewritten to `@rpath` and the bundle is signed ad hoc (no Developer ID, so
macOS asks the player to allow it once). Nothing else needs installing.

## A launch

1. The launcher checks the game folder (the runtime's `game_check.py`: the 1.09 executable), and
   makes a backup of the active profile's saves.
2. It writes `bbport.ini` from its settings database, sets the environment (the profile's folder,
   the selected renderer and frame-rate mode, ...) and starts `run.sh` with the app's bash.
3. `run.sh` links the game's modules into one image, applies the patches and mods (a merged view;
   the game folder is never changed), sizes memory for the output, and starts `bb-probe`.
4. The game runs through bbcpu (or the recompiled library), on the runtime's PS4 libraries and
   renderer. While it runs, the launcher and the in-game menu exchange setting changes over the
   game's standard streams. The game shows trophy notices in its overlay; the launcher imports
   recorded unlocks.
5. The launcher hides to the menu bar during the game and comes back when it exits.

Details: the runtime's [architecture](https://github.com/bloodborne-native/bloodborne-runtime/blob/main/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md);
the launcher's [settings](https://github.com/bloodborne-native/bloodborne-launcher/blob/main/docs/SETTINGS.md)
and [profiles and saves](https://github.com/bloodborne-native/bloodborne-launcher/blob/main/docs/SAVE_MANAGER.md).

## Where it is going: native code

By default the game's code is translated while it runs, and every frame is the PS4's GPU command
buffers decoded into Metal calls. Two milestones replace both with native code; where each stands
is in [Status](STATUS.md#how-native-it-is):

- **The recompiler** turns the game's functions, from the player's own executable, into C
  compiled into a native library, checked against calls recorded from the original. Every
  function runs recompiled, with less CPU time than the translator, and the launcher builds the
  library on the player's Mac. R4 named the engine's render code, its synchronization and its
  busiest functions, which the next steps use
  ([Recompilation](https://github.com/bloodborne-native/bloodborne-recomp/blob/main/docs/RECOMPILATION.md)).
- **The native renderer** draws with Metal directly on macOS, without Vulkan or MoltenVK (the
  MoltenVK fallback stays selectable until N5 is accepted; Linux keeps its Vulkan backend), through
  the project's own GPU interface, the render adapter. The goal is for the adapter to take the
  engine's draws, with their draw state, instead of the PS4 command buffers the engine writes
  under them. N6 found that boundary and every input of a draw in the engine's state; N2 builds the
  shaders to read that state, then builds the game's shaders once, ahead of time, as native
  shaders for each platform (Metal on macOS and iOS, SPIR-V for Vulkan); N3 takes textures as the
  objects the engine creates, without a second copy of each
  ([Native renderer](https://github.com/bloodborne-native/bloodborne-runtime/blob/main/docs/NATIVE_RENDERER.md)).

Only the tools are published, never the game's code.
